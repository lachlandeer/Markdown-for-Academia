## Academic Markdown Examples

In this repository I collect examples that use markdown to produce pdf documents useful to academic researchers.
Specifically I assemble markdown files that then use pandoc to create (hopefully) nice looking documents.

Currently implemented:

* Slides using Beamer and a custom color theme

My work set up is as follows (in case it doesn't build somewhere):

- installed software 
    + MiKTeX
    + Pandoc (and therefore Python)
    + Sublime Text 2
        * MarkdownEditing
        * AcademicMarkdown
        * WordCount
        * Citer
